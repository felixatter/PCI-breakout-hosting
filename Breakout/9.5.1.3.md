#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Criminals will often pose as authorized maintenance personnel to gain access to POI devices.
**Good Practice**
Personnel training should include being alert to and questioning anyone who shows up to do POI maintenance to ensure they are authorized and have a valid work order, including any agents, maintenance or repair personnel, technicians, service providers, or other third parties. All third parties requesting access to devices should always be verified before being provided access—for example, by checking with management or phoning the POI maintenance company, such as the vendor or acquirer, for verification. Many criminals will try to fool personnel by dressing for the part (for example, carrying toolboxes and dressed in work apparel), and could also be knowledgeable about locations of devices, so personnel should be trained to always follow procedures.
Another trick that criminals use is to send a “new” POI device with instructions for swapping it with a legitimate device and “returning” the legitimate device. The criminals may even provide return postage to their specified address. Therefore, personnel should always verify with their manager or supplier that the device is legitimate and came from a trusted source before installing it or using it for business.
**Examples**
Suspicious behavior that personnel should be aware of includes attempts by unknown persons to unplug or open devices.
Ensuring personnel are aware of mechanisms for reporting suspicious behavior and who to report such behavior to—for example, a manager or security officer—will help reduce the likelihood and potential impact of a device being tampered with or substituted.
