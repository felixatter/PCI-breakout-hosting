#### Guidance
**Purpose**
It is imperative that the lifecycle of a user ID (additions, deletions, and modifications) is controlled so that only authorized accounts can perform functions, actions are auditable, and privileges are limited to only what is required.
Attackers often compromise an existing account and then escalate the privileges of that account to perform unauthorized acts, or they may create new IDs to continue their activity in the background. It is essential to detect and respond when user accounts are created or changed outside the normal change process or without corresponding authorization.
