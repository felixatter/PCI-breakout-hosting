#### Guidance
**Purpose**
A default setting of “deny all” ensures no one is granted access unless a rule is established specifically granting such access.
**Good Practice**
It is important to check the default configuration of access control systems because some are set by default to “allow all,” thereby permitting access unless/until a rule is written to specifically deny it.
