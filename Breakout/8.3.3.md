#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Malicious individuals use "social engineering” techniques to impersonate a user of a system —for example, calling a help desk and acting as a legitimate user—to have an authentication factor changed so they can use a valid user ID.
Requiring positive identification of a user reduces the probability of this type of attack succeeding.
**Good Practice**
Modifications to authentication factors for which user identity should be verified include but are not limited to performing password resets, provisioning new hardware or software tokens, and generating new keys.
**Examples**
Methods to verify a user’s identity include a secret question/answer, knowledge-based information, and calling the user back at a known and previously established phone number.
