#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Entities are best placed to determine the frequency of POI device inspections based on the environment in which the device operates.
**Good Practice**
The frequency of inspections will depend on factors such as the location of a device and whether the device is attended or unattended. For example, devices left in public areas without supervision by the organization’s personnel might have more frequent inspections than devices kept in secure areas or supervised when accessible to the public. In addition, many POI vendors include guidance in their user documentation about how often POI devices should be checked, and for what – entities should consult their vendors’ documentation and incorporate those recommendations into their periodic inspections.
