#### Guidance
**Purpose**
It is critical to have a process or system that links user access to system components accessed. Malicious individuals could obtain knowledge of a user account with access to systems in the CDE, or they could create a new, unauthorized account to access cardholder data.
**Good Practice**
A record of all individual access to cardholder data can identify which accounts may have been compromised or misused.
