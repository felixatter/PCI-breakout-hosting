#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Malicious users often attempt to alter audit logs to hide their actions. A record of access allows an organization to trace any inconsistencies or potential tampering of the logs to an individual account. Having logs identify changes, additions, and deletions to the audit logs can help retrace steps made by unauthorized personnel.
