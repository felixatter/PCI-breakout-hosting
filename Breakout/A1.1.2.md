#### Guidance

**Purpose**
It is important that a multi-tenant service provider define controls so that each customer can only access their own environment and CDE to prevent unauthorized access from one customer’s environment to another.
**Examples**
In a cloud-based infrastructure, such as an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offering, the customers’ CDE may include virtual network devices and virtual servers that are configured and managed by the customers, including operating systems, files, memory, etc.
