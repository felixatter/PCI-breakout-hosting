#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Without appropriate physical security over access to wireless components and devices, and computer networking and telecommunications equipment and lines, malicious users could gain access to the entityâ€™s network resources. Additionally, they could connect their own devices to the network to gain unauthorized access to the CDE or systems connected to the CDE.
Additionally, securing networking and communications hardware prevents malicious users from intercepting network traffic or physically connecting their own devices to wired network resources.
