### Requirements and Testing Procedures

#### Defined Approach Requirements
5.2.1 An anti-malware solution(s) is deployed on all system components, except for those system components identified in periodic evaluations per Requirement 5.2.3 that concludes the system components are not at risk from malware.

#### Defined Approach Testing Procedures
5.2.1.a Examine system components to verify that an anti-malware solution(s) is deployed on all system components, except for those determined to not be at risk from malware based on periodic evaluations per Requirement 5.2.3.
5.2.1.b For any system components without an anti-malware solution, examine the periodic evaluations to verify the component was evaluated and the evaluation concludes that the component is not at risk from malware.

#### Guidance
**Purpose**
There is a constant stream of attacks targeting newly discovered vulnerabilities in systems previously regarded as secure. Without an anti-malware solution that is updated regularly, new forms of malware can be used to attack systems, disable a network, or compromise data.
**Good Practice**
It is beneficial for entities to be aware of "zero-day" attacks (those that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability) and consider solutions that focus on behavioral characteristics and will alert and react to unexpected behavior.
**Definitions**
System components known to be affected by malware have active malware exploits available in the real world (not only theoretical exploits).
