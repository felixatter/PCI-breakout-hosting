#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Establishing procedures for granting, managing, and removing access when it is no longer needed ensures non-authorized individuals are prevented from gaining access to areas containing cardholder data. In addition, it is important to limit access to the actual badging system and badging materials to prevent unauthorized personnel from making their own badges and/or setting up their own access rules.
**Good Practice**
It is important to visually identify the personnel that are physically present, and whether the individual is a visitor or an employee.
**Examples**
One way to identify personnel is to assign them badges.
