### Requirements and Testing Procedures

#### Defined Approach Requirements
A1.1.4 The effectiveness of logical separation controls used to separate customer environments is confirmed at least once every six months via penetration testing.

-END Defined Approach Requirements- 
#### Customized Approach Objective

Segmentation of customer environments from other environments is periodically validated to be effective.

-END Customized Approach Objective- 
#### Applicability Notes

The testing of adequate separation between customers in a multi-tenant service provider environment is in addition to the penetration tests specified in Requirement 11.4.6.
This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

-END Applicability Notes- 
#### Defined Approach Testing Procedures

A1.1.4 Examine the results from the most recent penetration test to verify that testing confirmed the effectiveness of logical separation controls used to separate customer environments.

#### Guidance

**Purpose**
Multi-tenant services providers are responsible for managing the segmentation between their customers.
Without technical assurance that segmentation controls are effective, it is possible that changes to the service provider’s technology would inadvertently create a vulnerability that could be exploited across all the service provider’s customers.
**Good Practice**
Effectiveness of separation techniques can be confirmed by using service-provider-created temporary (mock-up) environments that represent customer environments and attempting to 1) access one temporary environment from another environment, and 2) access a temporary environment from the Internet.
