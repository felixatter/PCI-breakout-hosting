Malicious software (malware) is software or firmware designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's knowledge or consent, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the ownerâ€™s data, applications, or operating system.
Examples include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, keyloggers, and rootkits, malicious code, scripts, and links.
Malware can enter the network during many business-approved activities, including employee e-mail (for example, via phishing) and use of the Internet, mobile computers, and storage devices, resulting in the exploitation of system vulnerabilities.
Using anti-malware solutions that address all types of malware helps to protect systems from current and evolving malware threats.
Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.
