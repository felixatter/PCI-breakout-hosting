-END Applicability Notes- 
#### Defined Approach Testing Procedures
8.3.2.a Examine vendor documentation and system configuration settings to verify that authentication factors are rendered unreadable with strong cryptography during transmission and storage.
8.3.2.b Examine repositories of authentication factors to verify that they are unreadable during storage.
8.3.2.c Examine data transmissions to verify that authentication factors are unreadable during transmission.

#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Network devices and applications have been known to transmit unencrypted, readable authentication factors (such as passwords and passphrases) across the network and/or store these values without encryption. As a result, a malicious individual can easily intercept this information during transmission using a “sniffer,” or directly access unencrypted authentication factors in files where they are stored, and then use this data to gain unauthorized access.
