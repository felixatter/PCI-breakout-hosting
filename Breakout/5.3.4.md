**Purpose**
It is important to track the effectiveness of the anti-malware mechanisms—for example, by confirming that updates and scans are being performed as expected, and that malware is identified and addressed. Audit logs also allow an entity to determine how malware entered the environment and track its activity when inside the entity’s network.
