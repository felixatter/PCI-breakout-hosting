#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Audit logs must exist for all system components. Audit logs send alerts the system administrator, provides data to other monitoring mechanisms, such as intrusion-detection systems (IDS) and security information and event monitoring systems (SIEM) tools, and provide a history trail for post-incident investigation.
Logging and analyzing security-relevant events enable an organization to identify and trace potentially malicious activities.
**Good Practice**
When an entity considers which information to record in their logs, it is important to remember that information stored in audit logs is sensitive and should be protected per requirements in this standard. Care should be taken to only store essential information in the audit logs to minimize risk.
