#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Controlling physical access to sensitive areas helps ensure that only authorized personnel with a legitimate business need are granted access.
**Good Practice**
Where possible, organizations should have policies and procedures to ensure that before personnel leaving the organization, all physical access mechanisms are returned, or disabled as soon as possible upon their departure. This will ensure personnel cannot gain physical access to sensitive areas once their employment has ended.
