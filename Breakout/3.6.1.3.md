#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Restricting the number of people who have access to cleartext cryptographic key components reduces the risk of stored account data being retrieved or rendered visible by unauthorized parties.
**Good Practice**
Only personnel with defined key custodian responsibilities (creating, altering, rotating, distributing, or otherwise maintaining encryption keys) should be granted access to key components.
Ideally this will be a very small number of people.
