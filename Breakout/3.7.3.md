#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Storing keys without proper protection could provide access to attackers, resulting in the decryption and exposure of account data.
**Good Practice**
Data encryption keys can be protected by encrypting them with a key-encrypting key.
Keys can be stored in a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
Secret or private keys that can decrypt data should never be present in source code.
