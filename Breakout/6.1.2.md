#### Guidance
**Purpose**
If roles and responsibilities are not formally assigned, systems will not be securely maintained, and their security level will be reduced.
**Good Practice**
Roles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.
**Examples**
A method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).
