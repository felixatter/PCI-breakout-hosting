#### Applicability Notes

-END Applicability Notes- 
#### Defined Approach Testing Procedures

#### Guidance
**Purpose**
If password history is not maintained, the effectiveness of changing passwords is reduced, as previous passwords can be reused over and over. Requiring that passwords cannot be reused for a period reduces the likelihood that passwords that have been guessed or brute-forced will be re-used in the future.
Passwords or passphrases may have previously been changed due to suspicion of compromise or because the password or passphrase exceeded its effective use period, both of which are reasons why previously used passwords should not be reused.
