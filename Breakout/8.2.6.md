#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Accounts that are not used regularly are often targets of attack since it is less likely that any changes, such as a changed password, will be noticed. As such, these accounts may be more easily exploited and used to access cardholder data.
**Good Practice**
Where it may be reasonably anticipated that an account will not be used for an extended period of time, such as an extended leave of absence, the account should be disabled as soon as the leave begins, rather than waiting 90 days.
