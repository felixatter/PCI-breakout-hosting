#### Guidance
**Purpose**
If exceptions and anomalies identified during the log-review process are not investigated, the entity may be unaware of unauthorized and potentially malicious activities occurring within their network.
**Good Practice**
Entities should consider how to address the following when developing their processes for defining and managing exceptions and anomalies:
- How log review activities are recorded,
- How to rank and prioritize exceptions and anomalies,
- What procedures should be in place to report and escalate exceptions and anomalies, and
- Who is responsible for investigating and for any remediation tasks.
