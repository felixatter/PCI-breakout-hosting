#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Restricting access to network jacks (or network ports) will prevent malicious individuals from plugging into readily available network jacks and gaining access to the CDE or systems connected to the CDE.
**Good Practice**
Whether logical or physical controls, or a combination of both, are used, they should prevent an individual or device that is not explicitly authorized from being able to connect to the network.
**Examples**
Methods to meet this requirement include network jacks located in public areas and areas accessible to visitors could be disabled and only enabled when network access is explicitly authorized. Alternatively, processes could be implemented to ensure that visitors are escorted at all times in areas with active network jacks.
