#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Accounts with increased access privileges, such as the “administrator” or “root” account, have the potential to significantly impact the security or operational functionality of a system. Without a log of the activities performed, an organization is cannot trace any issues resulting from an administrative mistake or misuse of privilege back to the specific action and account.
**Definitions**
Accounts with administrative access are those assigned with specific privileges or abilities for that account to manage systems, networks, and/or applications. The functions or activities considered to be administrative are beyond those performed by regular users as part of routine business functions.
