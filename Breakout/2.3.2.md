#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Changing wireless encryption keys whenever someone with knowledge of the key leaves the organization or moves to a role that no longer requires knowledge of the key, helps keep knowledge of keys limited to only those with a business need to know.
Also, changing wireless encryption keys whenever a key is suspected or known to be comprised makes a wireless network more resistant to compromise.
**Good Practice**
This goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, including periodic changes of keys, changing keys via a defined “joiners-movers-leavers” (JML) process, implementing additional technical controls, and not using fixed pre-shared keys.
In addition, any keys that are known to be, or suspected of being, compromised should be managed in accordance with the entity’s incident response plan at Requirement 12.10.1.
