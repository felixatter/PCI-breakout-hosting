Malicious individuals, both external and internal to an entity, often use default passwords and other vendor default settings to compromise systems. These passwords and settings are well known and are easily determined via public information.
Applying secure configurations to system components reduces the means available to an attacker to compromise the system. Changing default passwords, removing unnecessary software, functions, and accounts, and disabling or removing unnecessary services all help to reduce the potential attack surface.
