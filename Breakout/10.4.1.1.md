#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Manual log reviews are difficult to perform, even for one or two systems, due to the amount of log data that is generated. However, using log harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized log management systems, event log analyzers, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions can help facilitate the process by identifying log events that need to be reviewed.
**Good Practice**
The entity should keep logging tools aligned with any changes in their environment by periodically reviewing tool settings and updating settings to reflect any changes.
