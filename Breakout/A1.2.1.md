#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Log information is useful for detecting and troubleshooting security incidents and is invaluable for forensic investigations. Customers therefore need to have access to these logs.
However, log information can also be used by an attacker for reconnaissance, and so a customer’s log information must only be accessible by the customer that the log relates to.
