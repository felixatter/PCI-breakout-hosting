#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Proper testing of the security incident response plan can identify broken business processes and ensure key steps are not missed, which could result in increased exposure during an incident. Periodic testing of the plan ensures that the processes remain viable, as well as ensuring that all relevant personnel in the organization are familiar with the plan.
**Good Practice**
The test of the incident response plan can include simulated incidents and the corresponding responses in the form of a “table-top exercise”, that include participation by relevant personnel. A review of the incident and the quality of the response can provide entities with the assurance that all required elements are included in the plan.
