#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Maintaining a current list of all system components will enable an organization to define the scope of its environment and implement PCI DSS requirements accurately and efficiently. Without an inventory, some system components could be overlooked and be inadvertently excluded from the organizationâ€™s configuration standards.
**Good Practice**
If an entity keeps an inventory of all assets, those system components in scope for PCI DSS should be clearly identifiable among the other assets.
Inventories should include containers or images that may be instantiated.
Assigning an owner to the inventory helps to ensure the inventory stays current.
**Examples**
Methods to maintain an inventory include as a database, as a series of files, or in an inventory-management tool.
