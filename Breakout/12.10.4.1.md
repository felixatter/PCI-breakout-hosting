#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Each entity’s environment and incident response plan are different and the approach will depend on a number of factors, including the size and complexity of the entity, the degree of change in the environment, the size of the incident response team, and the turnover in personnel.
Performing a risk analysis will allow the entity to determine the optimum frequency for training personnel with incident response responsibilities.
