#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Often a malicious individual who has entered the network will try to edit the audit logs to hide their activity. Without adequate protection of audit logs, their completeness, accuracy, and integrity cannot be guaranteed, and the audit logs can be rendered useless as an investigation tool after a compromise. Therefore, audit logs should be protected on the originating systems as well as anywhere else they are stored.
**Good Practice**
Entities should attempt to prevent logs from being exposed in public-accessible locations.
