#### Guidance
**Purpose**
A thorough process for engaging TPSPs, including details for selection and vetting prior to engagement, helps ensure that a TPSP is thoroughly vetted internally by an entity prior to establishing a formal relationship and that the risk to cardholder data associated with the engagement of the TPSP is understood.
**Good Practice**
Specific due-diligence processes and goals will vary for each organization. Elements that should be considered include the providerâ€™s reporting practices, breach-notification and incident response procedures, details of how PCI DSS responsibilities are assigned between each party, how the TPSP validates their PCI DSS compliance and what evidence they provide.
