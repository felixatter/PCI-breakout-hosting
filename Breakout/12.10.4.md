#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Without a trained and readily available incident response team, extended damage to the network could occur, and critical data and systems may become “polluted” by inappropriate handling of the targeted systems. This can hinder the success of a post-incident investigation.
**Good Practice**
It is important that all personnel involved in incident response are trained and knowledgeable about managing evidence for forensics and investigations.
