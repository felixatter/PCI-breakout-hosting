#### Guidance
**Purpose**
File integrity monitoring or change-detection systems check for changes to critical files and notify when such changes are identified. For file integrity monitoring purposes, an entity usually monitors files that do not regularly change, but when changed, indicate a possible compromise.
**Good Practice**
Software used to monitor changes to audit logs should be configured to provide alerts when existing log data or files are changed or deleted. However, new log data being added to an audit log should not generate an alert.
