#### Guidance
**Purpose**
The inventory of trusted keys helps the entity keep track of the algorithms, protocols, key strength, key custodians, and key expiry dates. This enables the entity to respond quickly to vulnerabilities discovered in encryption software, certificates, and cryptographic algorithms.
**Good Practice**
For certificates, the inventory should include the issuing CA and certification expiration date.
