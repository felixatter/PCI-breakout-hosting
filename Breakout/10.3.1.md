#### Guidance
**Purpose**
Audit log files contain sensitive information, and read access to the log files must be limited only to those with a valid business need. This access includes audit log files on the originating systems as well as anywhere else they are stored.
**Good Practice**
Adequate protection of the audit logs includes strong access control that limits access to logs based on “need to know” only and the use of physical or network segregation to make the logs harder to find and modify.
