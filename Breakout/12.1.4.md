#### Guidance
**Purpose**
To ensure someone with sufficient authority and responsibility is actively managing and championing the organization’s information security program, accountability and responsibility for information security needs to be assigned at the executive level within an organization.
Common executive management titles for this role include Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and Chief Security Officer (CSO – to meet this requirement, the CSO role must be responsible for information security). These positions are often at the most senior level of management and are part of the chief executive level or C-level, typically reporting to the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors.
**Good Practice**
Entities should also consider transition and/or succession plans for these key personnel to avoid potential gaps in critical security activities.
