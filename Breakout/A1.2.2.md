#### Guidance
**Purpose**
In the event of a suspected or confirmed breach of confidentiality of cardholder data, a customer’s forensic investigator aims to find the cause of the breach, exclude the attacker from the environment, and ensure all unauthorized access is removed.
Prompt and efficient responses to forensic investigators’ requests can significantly reduce the time taken for the investigator to secure the customer’s environment.
