#### Defined Approach Testing Procedures
3.7.7.a Examine the documented key-management policies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data and verify that they define prevention of unauthorized substitution of cryptographic keys.
3.7.7.b Interview personnel and/or observe processes to verify that unauthorized substitution of keys is prevented.

#### Guidance
**Purpose**
If an attacker is able to substitute an entityâ€™s key with a key the attacker knows, the attacker will be able to decrypt all data encrypted with that key.
**Good Practice**
The encryption solution should not allow for or accept substitution of keys from unauthorized sources or unexpected processes.
Controls should include ensuring that individuals with access to key components or shares do not have access to other components or shares that form the necessary threshold to derive the key.
